      <div class="about-text">
        <p>Ben arrived on earth clutching a box of crayons in one hand and a drawing book in the other. Early life drawing classes with the crazy hippies out the back of Bellingen on the North NSW Coast led to an interest in art but quickly gave him cause to leave that free and easy life and head to the big smoke for some real training. Years of slaving away surfing and doodling lead to an Art Express exhibition and a Design bachelor degree. Following this he soon realised that living on the pens is a hard way to make a crust which led to a second degree in product and he focused all his energy on getting some free threads. When not designing, Ben can be found in front of a computer drawing or hunched over a beer coaster contemplating the ultimate design for world domination.</p>
          <p>Creative designer with impressive experience through the entire design process from initial concept through to the final product and branding. Over 20 years experience in design, branding, art direction, graphics and product development. Strong background in all aspects of marketing, buying, licensing, merchandising, costings, employee/customer relations, scheduling (time lines) and team management. Effective communication skills between design, marketing, production and off-shore suppliers to manage the final brand experience. Proven excellence in creative concept development combined with premium organisational and communiction skills.</p> 
          <p>in vendor relations, negotiation and coordination. Solid knowledge of product / garment and accessories construction, costing and retail costing. First rate trend development and research skills combined with solid experience across soft and hardgoods. Excellent abilities across a range of disciplines including Menswear, Kids, Womenswear and Accessories. High level computer skills across Adobe Creative Suite including: Advanced Photo Shop, Advanced Illustrator, Advanced In-Design. 
          An energetic individual with a pragmatic style and ability to manage a fast paced design studio effectively to achieve a desired high level of product and brand recognition.</p>
